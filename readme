To start a node:
- navigate to nodes folder
- start consul
- start node

to start node :
go run main.go [id] [port] [sharedPort]

id: this should be unique amongst the nodes
port: the port this node will be listening on
sharedport: the port which all nodes use to communicate. This should be the same for all nodes

example : 
go run main.go 3 :5002 localhost:8500

to start consul : 
consul agent -dev
to end consul :
consul leave

A Note on the logs:
the logs are not automatically deleted
For ease of reading it is recommmended that you manually delete the logs before starting any nodes
